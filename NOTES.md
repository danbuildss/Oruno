# NOTES — Project memory

**Read this before any task.** Update it after every meaningful session. History lives in `docs/project/SESSION_LOG.md`; don't delete context, move it there.

_Last updated: 2026-10-30_

## 1. Current project status

Phase 0 closed (D-015). Phase 1 backend foundation built and tested; awaiting Dan's exit approval. No money spent. Nothing deployed.

## 2. Current development phase

**Phase 1 — Backend Foundation** (IN REVIEW, exit approval pending). See `PLAN.md`.

## 3. Last completed task

Phase 1 build: T-101 to T-109 VERIFIED (commit `4734e4b`). T-110 (CI) and T-111 (exit) in review.

## 4. Current implementation state

Backend skeleton in `src/` (branch `phase1/backend-foundation`):
- config validation (`src/config.ts`);
- Postgres via Kysely with migrations (`src/db/`); tables `operators`, `audit_events` (append-only);
- pino logging with secret redaction (`src/logger.ts`);
- Fastify app with structured errors (`src/app.ts`, `src/http/`);
- `GET /health`, `GET /v1/operator/me`;
- hashed operator API keys + `pnpm operator:create` (`src/auth/`, `src/cli/`);
- pg-boss job runner (`src/jobs/`);
- tests in `tests/`; CI in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

No drops, claims, ledger or provider code yet (Phases 2–4).

## 5. What is working

Verified on commit `4734e4b` (36/36 tests, lint, typecheck, build; manual start-up check). See `TESTING.md`:
config validation; migrations up/down; append-only audit log; health check; operator key auth; secret redaction in logs; error responses; background jobs.

## 6. What is broken

Nothing known.

## 7. Known limitations (from research, not yet tested)

- Surplus budgets have day and month windows only; no lifetime window found. A monthly cap can double if a drop crosses a month boundary.
- Surplus charges a per-request flat fee ($0.003 per `/x402/info`); unconfirmed whether it applies to API-key traffic. Could take a large share of a $5 cap.
- On Surplus's Anthropic endpoint, "out of credit" appears as a generic `400 invalid_request_error`. Claimers need clear onboarding text.
- Surplus verifies seller reachability and health, not model quality (weights, quantization, injected prompts).

## 8. Outstanding bugs

None known.

## 9. Important architectural decisions

See `DECISIONS.md`. Summary:
- APPROVED: D-001 credit drops first · D-002 Surplus Pattern A · D-006 name Oruno · D-007 Apache-2.0 · D-008 X/GitHub sign-in, wallet optional · D-009 $5 cap · D-010 backend-first process · D-011 funding in USDC on Base.
- APPROVED (via D-012): D-003 provider caps + our ledger · D-004 no own gateway in V1 · D-005 TypeScript + Postgres monolith · V1 scope.
- APPROVED: D-013 eligibility thresholds · D-014 GitHub-only sign-in for Drop #1 · D-015 Phase 0 closed, Surplus spike moved before Phase 4 · D-016 Phase 1 stack.

## 10. Pending approvals

| Item | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 1 exit → start Phase 2** | `PLAN.md`, T-111 | BP-1 and BP-2 VERIFIED; CI to run on the pull request |
| Claimer terms draft | T-009, `docs/legal/CLAIMER_TERMS.md` | Then a lawyer review |
| Spending: $20 test key | T-006 | Deferred by Dan ("5 later") |

## 11. Next recommended task

1. Dan: review Phase 1; approve the exit and Phase 2 (Drop and Claim Engine) start.
2. Open a pull request for `phase1/backend-foundation` so CI runs (T-110).
3. Carried forward for Phase 4: Surplus answers (T-004, Dan asked), admin key (T-003), $20 spike (T-006), claimer terms legal review (T-009).

## 12. Relevant commits

- `5f96e34` Initial commit
- `ed7936e` First foundation docs (superseded by `c3b2a76`)
- `c3b2a76` Documentation system and Apache-2.0 license
- `4d32768` Funding decision D-011
- `c2ca114` V1 scope and architecture approval; sign-in research; draft claimer terms
- `121e193` D-014 GitHub-only sign-in; name check
- `a26e9b9` Bankr answer; name registration deferred
- `db5af0c` D-015, D-016; Phase 1 tasks
- `4734e4b` **Phase 1 backend foundation**

## 13. Important testing results

2026-10-30, `4734e4b`: 36/36 tests pass on real Postgres 16; lint, typecheck and build clean; manual start-up, health, auth, graceful shutdown and migration round trip all as expected. Full log in `TESTING.md`.

## 14. Deployment status

Nothing deployed. No environments exist. Local development only (Postgres on the dev machine).

## 15. Unresolved technical questions

**Surplus (ask in writing, T-004):**
1. Is there a lifetime budget window?
2. Does the per-request flat fee apply to API-key traffic?
3. Which sellers serve Claude models, and is that supply legitimately sourced under model providers' terms?
4. Would a future Oruno gateway count as a "directly competing routing service" (§8)?

**Bankr (T-005):** answered — credit can't be shared. Partnership interest still open for later.

**Ours:**
- Confirm GitHub and X field names and pricing against the live official docs (blocked in this session) at Phase 2 start.
- How we detect key sharing with only provider usage data (IPs may not be visible).
- Who does the one-hour legal review of claimer terms (T-009).
